# To include a distro in WSL

## Open PowerShell with administrator privileges and type and press Enter:
wsl --install -d ubuntu
## or simply
wsl --install

## Type the following to check the distros available:
wsl --list


# To remove a distro from WSL:

## Type the following command to view a list of all available distros and press Enter: 
wsl --list
## or
wsl -l

## Type the following command to set a distro as the new default on Windows and press Enter:
wsl --unregister DISTRO-NAME

## In the command, replace DISTRO-NAME with the name of the distro you want to set as default (see step 3). For example, this command unregisters and deletes the Ubuntu Linux distribution:
wsl --unregister Ubuntu

## Type the following command to confirm distros and press Enter:
wsl --list

## Once you complete the steps, the distro will reset and no longer be available in WSL, but it wonâ€™t be uninstalled from the computer. If you want to reinstall the distro, you can open it again from the Start menu.
